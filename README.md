### Code style guide

- Pay attention to the linter!
- Don't use semicolons
- Two spaces -- for indentation
- Trailing commas where possible
- Use `const` or `let` over `var`
- Use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files
- Use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code
- Put import statements at top
- Put the default export at bottom
- Consider splitting up any file larger than 50 lines
- Define container components and presentational components in separate files
- Use the ["ducks" pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for redux
- Name files using lowercase-and-dashes instead of camelCase or PascalCase, except for when the default export is a class, then use PascalCase
- Define react components as pure functions (instead of classes) whenever possible
- Single quotes for strings â€“ except to avoid escaping
- No unused variables
- Space after keywords `if (condition) { ... }`
- Space after function name `function name (arg) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==`

### Linter Guide

* `npm install -g eslint`
* In the root of your project, `eslint --init`
* You will then be prompted to choose how you want to configure ESLint - follow the style guide above
